			Kimbap (sometimes spelled gimbap) is made with steamed white rice and dried seaweed, which is of course similar to the Japanese version. But there are two big differences: the rice and the filling. While sushi rice is seasoned with vinegar, kimbap is instead cut with sesame oil and sweeter. Out sushi is made from cooked rice and ingredients such as vegetables, fish, and meats that are rolled in gim—dried sheets of seaweed.</p>
